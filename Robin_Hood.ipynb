        "In 2-dimensional space a point can be defined by a pair of values ​​that correspond to the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) coordinates. The space can be divided into 4 zones (quadrants): Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. Whose unique joining point is the point (0, 0).\n",
        "\n",
        "If a point is in Q1, both its x and y coordinates are positive. I leave you a link to wikipedia so you can familiarize yourself with these quadrants.\n",
